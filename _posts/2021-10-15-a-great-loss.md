Today I was informed that two of my coworkers,and friends, were terminated after multiple years of service to the org after asking for more help before our largest yearly campaign. If they can be removed so easily, we can all be removed just as easily. 

## Welcome To JSWU 
This is the start of something very special, this is still a work in progress so expect things to be rough for a while. I've setup a discord server(link in the sidebar) if you'd like to join in on the conversation.

 -Talk soon
