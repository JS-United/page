Today I was informed that two of my coworkers, and friends, were terminated after multiple years of service to the organization. This morning, after asking for more help before our largest yearly campaign from their supervisors, they were told the department will be 'restructured' and that they were no longer needed. If they can be removed so easily, we can all be removed just as easily. 

## Welcome To JSWU 
This is the start of something very special, it's is still a work in progress so expect things to be a little rough around the edges for a while. I've setup a discord server(link in the sidebar) if you'd like to join in on the conversation.

-Talk soon
